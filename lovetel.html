      <p>My Dearest Prashu,</p>
      <p>
        On this special day, I just want you to know that you are the most
        precious gift life has ever given me. Every smile of yours lights up
        my entire world and every word of yours is like music to my heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are not just my love, you are my best friend, my safe place, my
        everything. With you, even ordinary moments become magical. I promise
        to stand by you, love you endlessly, and cherish every heartbeat that
        brings me closer to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forever yours, <br>
        With all the love in the world, <br>
        <span class="signature">â€” Your Jugal ðŸ’–</span>
